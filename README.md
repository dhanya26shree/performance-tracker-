This repository contains a Power BI report designed to track and visualize key performance metrics in a structured and interactive manner. The project utilizes Power BI’s robust features, including data modeling, DAX measures, and custom visual design, to deliver insightful analytics across different operational dimensions.The objective of this report is to help users monitor performance through visual dashboards, analyze trends over time, compare metrics across departments or categories, and make informed decisions based on clear data insights. Each page in the report is interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific areas of interest.Key features of this project include dynamic dashboards that update in real time, analytical views focused on key performance indicators, and auto-detected relationships between tables for seamless integration. A custom visual theme has been applied (referenced from CY24SU10.json) to maintain visual consistency across pages. The report supports intuitive navigation and is structured across multiple pages, each dedicated to a different area of analysis.This project was developed using Power BI for data transformation and visualization, DAX for building calculated metrics, and structured layout definitions for the report’s design. It may be connected to data sources like Excel or spreadsheets depending on your dataset, and includes a custom JSON theme to enhance its visual presentation.To use the report, open the project.pbix file in Power BI Desktop. Once open, explore the different report pages to view the visualizations. You can apply filters or slicers to analyze data for specific time periods, departments, or performance metrics. The visuals can be exported or shared as needed, including options to publish to Power BI service or export to PDF/PowerPoint for presentations.Internally, the report includes a structured layout, a compressed data model, and metadata defining versioning and report configurations. The applied theme ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the report. These components work together to provide a professional, user-friendly experience.This project is intended to support stakeholders in identifying trends, recognizing areas of improvement, and enhancing decision-making through well-designed data storytelling. The file included in this repository is project.pbix, which contains the complete Power BI report.If you have suggestions, feedback, or would like to adapt this report to a specific use case or industry (such as HR, finance, or education), feel free to contribute or raise issues. This project is open to customization and collaboration.
